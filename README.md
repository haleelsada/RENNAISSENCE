This report explores methods for extracting the layout of text in an image of printed text. The task was to use AI for this purpose, but instead, I tried to use a statistical approach without AI. It was working for around 75% of the time.
I have completed one task related to this project, and this is an additional task that I attempted as an extension of my work.
